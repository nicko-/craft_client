# craft_client
Ruby client library for the ['Craft' Minecraft clone](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft)

## Installation
Add

    gem 'craft_client'

to your application's Gemfile, or run

    gem install craft_client

## Basic usage example
Require the library

    require 'craft_client'

Create a new Server object;

    server = CraftClient.new(USERNAME, IDENTITY_TOKEN, SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORT)

Attempt to connect to the server;

    server.connect

Send a chat message;

    server.send_chat_message('Hello world!')

Disconnect;

    server.disconnect

## Server events
To receive events from the server (new chat messages, block changes, etc), call server.get_event

    event = server.get_event

server.get_event blocks until it receives an event, from where it'll return a hash with the event data. If craft_client is unable to understand the message, it will return nil.
